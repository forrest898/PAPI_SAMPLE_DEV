This repository represents the first attempt to develop sampling with PAPI.

As of 2:56pm,
about half of the events for the Skylake processor series are working with an i7-6820HQ on a lenovo
t460p with ubuntu 16.04 LTS

about to completely reorganize the directory and add a decent makefile system (maybe....)
here goes nothing...

As of right now it appears sampling only works for 19 of the specified 50 events
that PEBS is supposed to be supported for. It's unclear whether I'm using the
erf_event_open interface wrong or if these events just dont work.

As the code stands right now, it takes the INTEL name for sampling events and
feeds them into libpfm in order to generate perf_event_attr structures, which
are modified slightly before use. As it progresses, the code should take generic
PAPI sampling names; these can then be used to translate to the INTEL name,
which can be fed to the call to pfm_get_os_event_encoding.
