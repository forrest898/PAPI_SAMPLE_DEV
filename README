This repository represents the first attempt to develop sampling with PAPI.

As of 2:56pm, 
about half of the events for the Skylake processor series are working with an i7-6820HQ on a lenovo
t460p with ubuntu 16.04 LTS 

6/25
about to completely reorganize the directory and add a decent makefile system (maybe....) 
here goes nothing...

6/27
As of right now it appears sampling only works for 19 of the specified 50 events that PEBS is supposed to be supported for. It's unclear whether I'm using the perf_event_open interface wrong or if these events just dont work.
