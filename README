This repository represents the first attempt to develop sampling with PAPI.

Usage:
Calling the script "test_script" like so:
	./test_script ./src/event_lists/LISTOFEVENTSFORYOURARCHITECTURE
will try to sample every event available for the architecture at a frequency
specified in the file src/test_events.c

History:

about half of the events for the Skylake processor series are working with an i7-6820HQ on a lenovo
t460p with ubuntu 16.04 LTS

about to completely reorganize the directory and add a decent makefile system (maybe....)
here goes nothing...

As of right now it appears sampling only works for 19 of the specified 50 events
that PEBS is supposed to be supported for. It's unclear whether I'm using the
erf_event_open interface wrong or if these events just dont work.

As the code stands right now, it takes the INTEL name for sampling events and
feeds them into libpfm in order to generate perf_event_attr structures, which
are modified slightly before use. As it progresses, the code should take generic
PAPI sampling names; these can then be used to translate to the INTEL name,
which can be fed to the call to pfm_get_os_event_encoding.

Verified that about 15 more events are *working* at least for SKYLAKE. The
sampling frequency had previously been set to a value that was too large to
catch sampling results for these events because the events do not trigger as
frequently as common ones.

Currently working to develop a test program for the HLE and RTM metrics. These
features correspond to specific assembly instructions, and therefore need a
separate test.
