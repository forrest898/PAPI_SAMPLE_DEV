How to pick size of MMAP?

7.1

Basically just use parse_record but send all data to a file?
	perf.data or other user specified file

7.2

User specifies a buffer which results are copied to.
	- user must then have their own mmap_read? handle the data and exit
	- how large would the linux mmap be by default?
	- follow a scheme like the papi_overflow function for initialization?

Implementation similar to overflow handler?
	write to buffer instead of to screen?

How do we tie the sampling interface to an eventset considering that it is
largely perf related and not PAPI code?
