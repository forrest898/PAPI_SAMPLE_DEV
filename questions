How to pick size of MMAP?

7.1

Basically just use parse_record but send all data to a file?
	perf.data or other user specified file

7.2

User specifies a buffer which results are copied to.
	- user must then have their own mmap_read? handle the data and exit 
	- how large would the linux mmap be by default?
	- follow a scheme like the papi_overflow function for initialization?

Implementation similar to overflow handler?
	write to buffer instead of to screen?
